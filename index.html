        <p class="text-center">My Mission:</p>
        <p>Two of my biggest passions and interests since childhood is coding and playing video games. I have always been curious on how computers and video games work. However, I was not able to really learn about technology as my opportunities throughout elementary and middle school was extremely limited.  As I was entering high school, more and more opportunities became available to me in order to learn more about computer science. My high school has a variety of computer science classes and I was motivated to take as many as I can. Even though the class made projects and practiced coding, I was not satisfied with the limited amount of projects we were making. I wanted to apply my knowledge to a project more interactive and meaningful to both myself and the world. As such, I took it upon myself to teach myself the programming languages I was not taught yet such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have been building my own projects I thought were useful in gaining experience. My experience includes making  websites and web applications, discord bots, and designing projects for other people to build. I am the kind of person who does not like to wait to be taught and likes to be challenged.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have indulged in plenty of hobbies throughout my life. The one most prevelant is playing video games. I cannot get enough of playing them. Since entering High School, I have learned how fun it is to code out websites. Whenever I can learn about
            code, I will take the chance to improve my knowledge. Another passion I have is for the trading card game "Yu-Gi-Oh". I only recently started to get really into it. I get extremely competitive with the game. I unfortunetely spend too much
            money on it. I built my very own PC last summer and it was very frustrating but by the end of it, I felt very satisfied and wouldnt mind doing it for a hobby.</p>
